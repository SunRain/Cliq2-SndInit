    <string name="InstructionsInfo">===HOW TO INSTALL ====\n
- Press the button to install the 2ndInit Recovery.\n
- The bootmenu will be download and installed. After it succeeds the top led will be green.\n
- Then disable USB debugging on Phone settings, and then reboot. You\'ll boot into bootmenu already.\n
- You must choose your default boot option, or else you\'ll always boot to bootmenu first.\n
- On each reboot when the led displays blue on startup press the key Volume Down to enter the BootMenu.\n


= HOW TO USE CUSTOM URL =\n
- You must provide a tar.gz file with similar structure of the ones I use. You can even provide the same bootmenus in different URLs, that is, mirror hosting. In case of doubt fell free to contact me.\n\n\n
